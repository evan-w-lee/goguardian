**actually doesn't work on school chromebooks rip*
<br/><br/>
<b>Instructions</b><br/>
From Chromebook start page: Pretend to login with a Microsoft account and then click more options, click Github, then *forgot password*, then the github logo in the center of the screen. Then navigate to the search bar and type in *evan-w-lee/goguardian*, then click the result and click the link below.

<br/>
<b>Explanation</b><br/>
Behind the fast-paced instructions is simply a loophole in a forgotten aspect of Microsoft login. When you attempt to sign into GitHub you have full access to the entire web, all you have to do is find a link to take you to a web browser.

<b>Updates</b><br/>
Currently working on web browser in web browser, you can find the test here:

<b>Self-protection</b><br/>
This isn't nefarious (trust me) just proof of concept. Anyone can use this if they like but I'm not going to so bye
